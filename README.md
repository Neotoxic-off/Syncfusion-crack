# Syncfusion crack
Latest release version: **31.1.22.0**

## Explanation
<p align="center">
This repository was initially released to highlight that Syncfusion denied my request for a free developer license.
Over time, I noticed that many developers were using Syncfusion and spending significant amounts of money on small-scale or personal projects far more than such components should cost.

## Usage
- Navigate to the folder corresponding to your desired version
- Download the required file(s)
- Copy them into your project, placing them in the same directory as the original unpatched files, and replace those files
- Done
