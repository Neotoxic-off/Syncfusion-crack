## Explanation
<p align="center">
  This repository was initially released to highlight that Syncfusion denied my request for a free developer license.
  Over time, I noticed that many developers were using Syncfusion and spending significant amounts of money on small-scale or personal projects far more than such components should cost.
  Additionally, this implementation bypasses few validation checks, resulting in a slight performance improvement due to reduced decoding and encoding overhead.

## Usage
- Navigate to the folder corresponding to your desired version
- Download the required file(s)
- Copy them into your project, placing them in the same directory as the original unpatched files, and replace those files
- Done
