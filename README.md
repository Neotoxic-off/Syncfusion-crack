## Information
<p align="center">
    Please note that I am notified immediately whenever a new update is released. However, I am not always able to apply the patch as soon as the update becomes available.
    For standard updates, patching may occur shortly after release. For more complex versions, additional time may be required to ensure stability, compatibility, and proper implementation.
    Thank you for your understanding and patience.

## Help
<p align="center">
  If a new version is released or a bug is found in the cracked version, please create an issue, and I will address it as soon as possible
  If you’re unsure about a crack found online, please verify its authenticity by comparing its signature with the official ones listed
  On the latest versions, the signatures are already contained in the .NFO file
